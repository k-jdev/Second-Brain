YES, i write the logic for jwt auth, that really cool, but i have many bugs, like when people send the void form, my app was crashed, but i can fix that. 
Today i'm training my legs and i'm really fine training them. 

Text on top i write in night and now i'm read all my notes, and i saw my things changes to negative when i started studying in university, i really don't why, but this is'nt good, i speak about my succeses
